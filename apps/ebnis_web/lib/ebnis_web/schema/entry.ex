    Data structure returned when creating multiple entries simultaneously.

    It looks like so:
    `typescript
    {
      successes?: [
        {
          expId: string;
          entries: Entry[]

          error: string
        }
      ]
    }
    `

    The inserts that succeed go into the `successes` field while those that fail
    go into `failures` field. Each field is an array of maps with a key `index` which maps to the index of the object in user's input from which we attempted to create the entry. The `index` is so that user knows how to map
    from the response we returned to the input the user supplied.

    In addition, we only get `successes` field if at least one input succeeds
    and we only get `failures` field if at least one input fails

    Variables for creating an entry field

    It is of the form:

    The `defId` key comes from experience to which this entry is associated and
    using this `defId`, we will retrieve the associated field definition for
    each field so as to ensure that we are storing valid JSON string data for
    the field. For instance, if user submits a field with JSON string data:
        {date: "2016-05-10"}
    and defId:
        field_definition_id_10000
    but when we query the experience for field definition id
    `field_definition_id_10000`, it tells us it should be associated with an
