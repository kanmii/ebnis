# When testing production build locally, we may want to use a locally running
# postgres server. The below helps map the database host inside the production
# container to local postgres server. Use like so:
# `docker run --add-host=$DOCKER_ADD_DB_HOST`
# You can obtain the docker host IP by running `ifconfig docker0`. It is the
# value of `inet`
# Do not forget to set value of `host` to same as $DATABASE_URL

# When testing production build locally, we may want to create the database
# automatically before phoenix server starts. Please set "false" if
# you do not want database created e.g. running on a heroku server which
# provides a provisioned postgresql database server, this variable mute be false
